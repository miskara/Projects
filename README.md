TietokantaProjekti_JAVA folder:

TietokantaProjekti_JAVA includes a school database project, in which i created a small java swing application.
The application connects to a MySQL database. The application works as a drink-list application, 
which shows the details of the drinks that are possible to be ordered. The user can also implement new drinks based on the
different mixers in the database. If the database doesn't have what the user wants, the user can also order more different mixers
to the database. For this application to work, a local MySQL server needs to be installed and the database needs to be created using the
.sql file in the root folder of the project.

in short, what user CAN do:
	- Browse drinks in database (see the cost, and ingredients).
	- Implement new drinks (add ingredients and select amount, select cost)
	- Order ingredients/mixers
	- Order NEW ingredients/mixers
	- Delete drinks from database
	- Consume ingredients/mixers by using the order button in the UI
